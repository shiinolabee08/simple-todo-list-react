# Simple To-do list
A simple To-do list application built by React version 17. This exercise shows to demonstrate my skills on React basic concepts in user interfaces such as use of <strong>class-based</strong> components, <strong>function-based</strong> components, <strong>state and behavior</strong> of objects, <strong>object destructing</strong>, <strong>custom DOM styling</strong>, <strong>high-order array methods</strong>, and <strong>custom methods</strong>. I haven't implemented yet of how to use Redux for state management mechanism.
